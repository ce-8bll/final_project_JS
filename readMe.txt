My project "Random Quote #BeHappy" offers random motivational quotes generated by clicking on the button "quote".
Each quote (with its respective author) is linked to a google map (API) coordinate to show from where the author of the quote is coming (worldwide quotes).
When clicking on the red marker for each generated map, one can read a summary of who the author is and a link to their wikipedia page; page which opens in a new tab to make the UX smoother.

This is purely a front-end project. It is planned to add much more quotes from an external file, make a sign up and login component (so far the button "add to favorite" has already been implemented to show what sort of future feature will be accessible through the user account), and make the app usable from different languages for worldwide users.
